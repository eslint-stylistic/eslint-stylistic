<!-- DO NOT IGNORE THE TEMPLATE! Thank you for contributing! -->

### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:

- [ ] Read the [Contributing Guide](https://eslint.style/contribute/guide).
- [ ] Check that there isn't already a PR that solves the problem the same way to avoid creating a duplicate.
- [ ] Provide a description in this PR that addresses **what** the PR is solving, or reference the issue that it solves (e.g. `fixes #123`).
- [ ] Ideally, include relevant tests that fail without this PR but pass with it.
- [ ] If this PR changes documented rule default options, I've confirmed it is not addressing the intentional difference between rule defaults and preset values described in `#890`.
