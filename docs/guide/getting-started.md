# Getting Started

ESLint Stylistic is a collection of stylistic rules for ESLint, migrated from `eslint` core and `@typescript-eslint` repo to shift the maintenance effort to the community. Learn more about [why we need this project](/guide/why).

## Plugin

ESLint Stylistic is provided as a unified plugin, which supports supports JS, TS and JSX out of the box.

[Check the rules and install guide](/rules) for more details.

:::info Unified Plugin

We used to provide separate plugins for each language like `@stylistic/eslint-plugin-js`, but **since v5**, we have merged them into a single plugin.

Those separated plugins would still work but would not receive new features. Please consider migrating to the unified plugin.

The legacy docs is available at [v4.eslint.style](https://v4.eslint.style/).
