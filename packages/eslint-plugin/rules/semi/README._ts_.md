# ts/semi

This rule extends the base [`semi`](/rules/js/semi) rule.
It adds support for TypeScript features that require semicolons.

See also the [`@typescript-eslint/member-delimiter-style`](member-delimiter-style.md) rule, which allows you to specify the delimiter for `type` and `interface` members.
